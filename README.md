Hungry Horace disassembly
=========================

A disassembly of the [Spectrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum)
version of
[Hungry Horace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_series#Hungry_Horace),
created using [SkoolKit](http://skoolkit.ca/).

To build the current development version, first either install SkoolKit, or
make a clone of the [SkoolKit repository](https://github.com/skoolkid/skoolkit)
and point the environment variable SKOOLKIT_HOME at it. Then:

    $ utils/mkhtml.py
