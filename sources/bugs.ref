[Bug:freeExtraLife:Free extra life]
Horace is given three lives before a game starts (see #R24787), but not long
after the game has started he's awarded an extra life, which is not supposed to
happen until the score hits 10,000. This is caused by the section of code at
#R26067, which miscalculates the 10,000s digit of the current score.

POKE #R26079(26079),61
